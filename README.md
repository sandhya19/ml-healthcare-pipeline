Components:

Data Ingestion: Fetch healthcare news articles from RSS feeds using Python.
Data Storage: Store raw and processed data into AWS S3 buckets.
Data Processing: Clean text, optional NLP enrichment (e.g., sentiment analysis, NER).
Data Modeling: Define schemas using AWS Glue Data Catalog.
Querying: Analyze structured data using AWS Athena.
Visualization: Build interactive dashboards in Amazon QuickSight.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

AWS CLI configured (aws configure)

IAM permissions for S3, Athena, Glue, QuickSight

Install Python dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment variables (Optional)
Create a .env file or set variables in the script:

AWS region
S3 bucket name
S3 folder path
RSS feed URL(s)

Run Data Ingestion

python scripts/ingest_data.py
This will fetch healthcare articles and upload them into your specified S3 bucket.

Dashboards
Once data is processed:

Use AWS Glue to create a catalog of your S3 data.

Query the cataloged data with AWS Athena.

Connect Amazon QuickSight to Athena to create dashboards.

Example Dashboards:
Sentiment trend over time
Top mentioned healthcare companies
Volume of articles per healthcare topic

Future Enhancements
Add Named Entity Recognition (NER) for deeper insights (companies, conditions, drugs).
Perform Sentiment Analysis automatically during ingestion.
Predict trending healthcare topics using machine learning models (BERTopic, Prophet).
Automate the entire pipeline using AWS Step Functions or Apache Airflow.
